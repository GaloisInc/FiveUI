<p>FiveUI is distributed as source code and as a browser extension for both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. This document describes the install process for these browsers, assuming that you have the FiveUI extension on your local computer.</p>
<h2 id="installing-fiveui-in-firefox">Installing FiveUI in Firefox</h2>
<p>FiveUI is currently supported on Firefox 10, although it should also work on newer versions and Firefox 3.6. Due to changes in the long-term support and Mozilla version numbering scheme, versions 4-9 are not supported.</p>
<p>The FiveUI Firefox extension is packaged in a file called <code>fiveui.xpi</code>. Locate this file in your distribution (or download) and take note of the location for the following steps. We will assume that it is located at <code>d:\binaries\fiveui.xpi</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Open Firefox, and load the <code>Add-ons Manager</code> from the main Firefox menu.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<ul>
<li><p>Within the <code>Add-ons Manager</code>, open the Gear menu and select <code>Install Add-on From File</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A file dialog should open, use this to browse to the <code>fiveui.xpi</code> file (in our case, <code>d:\binaries\fiveui.xpi</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click OK, and a warning dialog should appear. This dialog warns that the FiveUI author is not verified. Because this is a development release of FiveUI, the xpi file is not cryptographically signed, and therefore, Firefox is unable to verify the author identification.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <code>Install Now</code> button once it becomes active.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>FiveUI is now installed. The <a href="gettingStarted">Getting Started guide</a> explains how to configure and use the extension.</p>
<h2 id="installing-fiveui-in-chrome">Installing FiveUI in Chrome</h2>
<p>All recent versions of Google Chrome should support FiveUI.</p>
<p>Chrome is primarily designed to install extensions from the on-line extension marketplace, however, local extensions can be installed by navigating to the extension on disk. To do this, you must enter a <code>file:///</code> url in the url bar.</p>
<p>The following steps describe how to install FiveUI in Chrome, using an extension file from the local file system.</p>
<p>The FiveUI Chrome extension is packaged in a file called <code>fiveui.crx</code>. Locate this file in your distribution (or download) and take note of the location for the following steps. We will assume that it is located at <code>d:\binaries\fiveui.crx</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Open Google Chrome, and enter the <code>file:///</code> url in the url bar, as shown. In our case, the url is <code>file:///d:/binaries/fiveui.crx</code>.</li>
</ul>
